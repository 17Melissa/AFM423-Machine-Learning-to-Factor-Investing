# AFM423 GPR#2 â€“ Machine Learning for Factor Investing
## Description
This project applies the XGBoost algorithm to a supervised binary classification problem in the context of factor investing. The goal is to predict whether a stock will rank among the top 30% performers over the next three months, based on selected financial indicators. The implementation includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model tuning, evaluation, and result visualization.
